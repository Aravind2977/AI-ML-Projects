Rooms were quite outdated but they were clean and beds quite comfortable.  The main issue for us was noise and not from the streets of New York but within the hotel. Our room may as well have had no walls between us & the next room. While we understand hotel rooms are side by side however the walls really were paper thin in our room. Our neigbours weren\\u2019t noisy by intention but we could hear their conversations, hairdryer, phone ringing etc and this wasn\\u2019t helped by having a young child who was clearly struggling with sleep and as a result had our child awake too. They too would have been able to hear our noises also. Unfortunately this really did hamper during the day our enjoyment as everyone was tired. Ear plugs are definitely needed though if you\\u2019re sensitive to sounds when staying in this hotel and especially for your small kids if you have children with you.
